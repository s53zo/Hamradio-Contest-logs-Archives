Public logs gathered in github repo.

There are almost 1 milion logs in this repo. If you don't need all of them
you can git clone just part of the repo with (example)

git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/s53zo/Hamradio-Contest-logs-Archives.git
cd Hamradio-Contest-logs-Archives
git sparse-checkout set WAE/CW

If you want to me add another contest, let me know.

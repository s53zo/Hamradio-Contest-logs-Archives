SOAPBOX: Why we urgently need a serious WW/WPX PSK contest
SOAPBOX: Recently PSK modes are been forbidden in RTTY roundup contest, the only ARRL contest were they ere admitted. Even before very very few stations used PSK during roundup, so no much difference has been noted (and escluding FT* mode form contest is always a good thing indeed!)
SOAPBOX: The new ARRL Digital Contest didn't solve the issue because it has immediately become an FT* modes contest, nothing interesting there.
SOAPBOX: A contest without progressive number exchange is a non-sense US stations should exchange WAS as well as in roundup contest. A list of usable modes should be published in the rules as well. Qth locator exhange has been adopted only due to ft modes, but ft modes if are so limited should not be privileged at all. At the oppositie ft modes should be modified to be compliant with contest rules! There is no issue at all in PSK or similar mode (JS8 too) to exchange data as in any other contest.
SOAPBOX: The need for an ARRL PSK contest esplained.
SOAPBOX: After more than 20 years a serious PSK contest with same rules appliying in RTTY WW contest is still missing.
SOAPBOX: A contest with same rules of Roundup but limited to PSK modes will be of great interest. Same rules means that power limit (available in other psk contests) shall not apply for High Power category. By this way all big contest stations partecipating to RTTY contest will be attract to partecipate in this new PSK contest, while are missing from present psk contests due to theirs rules. Since PSK modes are by far more efficient than old RTTY, there will be a lot of fun for small stations working the world with a few watts as well ! For small station RTTY is very challenging and sometimes frustrating since 100W has to be considered a barely minimum power for RTTY dx.
SOAPBOX: Power limitation is sometimes addressed by other psk contest organisers due to splatter nearby stations. This cannot be a parameter since modern rigs have filters able to isolate a single PSK63 signal. The real issue nobody is addressing is that for inexplicable reasons in psk contest stations are reluctant to leave the psk frequency allocation 14.070, 21.070 and to use the rtty frequencies ususally empty when not used during RTTY contests.
SOAPBOX: The mistake again are the current psk contest rules indicating the frequency segment that is not adequate at all for contest (this is true expecially for 20 and 15 meters where at 14.074 and 21.074 there are FT* mode frequency allocations, in 40 meters here in Europe psk freq. is 7040 so there is a lot of empty freq before ft8 frequency, in fact here the stations are more distribuited over the band during psk contests)
SOAPBOX: Frequency allocation for a seriuos PSK contest should be indicated and there is a lot of space in unused rtty allocation (e.g. 14080-14120 as used during RTTY contests). In this way normal cq frequencies like 14.070 21.070 etc could remain clear for non contest psk operations.
SOAPBOX: PSK63 should be the "default" mode, but it would be a mistake to limit to only this mode, since PSK31 could be useful in difficult conditions and for low power stations, as well as PSK125 is faster than RTTY when conditions allow.
SOAPBOX: PSK contest adopting RTTY one rules would be a great fun for any kind of station!
SOAPBOX: After FT* modes introduction wonderful PSK modes have declined without any serious reason that is not good at all. A new ARRL WW PSK contest even if 20 years late, could greatly improve the situation expecially with propagation conditions getting better.

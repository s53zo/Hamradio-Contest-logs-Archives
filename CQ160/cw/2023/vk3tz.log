SOAPBOX: Did have the cluster running but not a single QSO came from a spot. Good opening on the first morning into EU which was ok for 20mins prior to Sunrise and about 5 minutes after. Otherwise no DX heard. Not a single USA station was heard on either night. Second morning not a single EU was heard. All QSOs with EU seemed to hear me rather well with only a 12m inverted L. Will improve to 22m when I repair the fibreglass pole wrecked by cockatoos. Environmentally protected but a voracious pest!!!
SOAPBOX: No new ones unfortunately for my quest for top band DXCC. Score no where near as good as 2022.

SOAPBOX: Entering this log just to say I was there, HI. Very brief and sporadic participation from 1000Z to 1500Z on Sunday. Not many stations heard, but did hear E2X and JA but they couldn't hear me. Band noise is very high in VK at this time of the year due to electrical storm activity. Antenna is a loaded inverted L, 14m high, 2 x 1/4 wave radials and 12 shorter radials (each 1/4 wave on 80m). (No separate low-noise Rx antenna at this time.)

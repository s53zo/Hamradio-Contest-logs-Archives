SOAPBOX: Apologies to OK7K for the dupe. My bad. It was Australia Day long weekend so I was away with friends for the weekend but back for our Sunday night and Monday morning, although exhausted from a fun filled weekend with my old Airforce buddies. Heard YB2DX loud for a new DXCC for me but he could not hear me. Also heard LX1NO for a new one but again not heard. The two HAs were new DXCC helping me to edge towards Top Band DXCC from a city lot in Oceania. 5 to go. Condx on Sunday night were not good with even ZL1AZ very weak.
SOAPBOX: The Sunrise peak here was very pronounced with many many EU being heard on my 40m Rotatable dipole as an RX antenna with W7IUV style pre-amp. SR at approx 1925z with signal peaking 10-15 mins prior and 5 - 10 mins after. Condx seemed fair to good but not excellent on Monday morning. Looking at DXCluster posts after the test it seems condx on Sunday morning (VK time) were not great so looks like I didn't miss much. Pity that propagation to NA has been so poor of late. I recall working KL7RA on SSB years ago and lament such great conditions.
SOAPBOX: Thanks for running the test, and even though my RX and TX is not so great, it is a help to chase DXCC and see so much activity on TopBand. Thanks to the EU who heard me. 20m inv L for TX antenna with about 30 to 40 shortish radials, the lot is not large enough for a full size radial.
SOAPBOX: Cheers

SOAPBOX: Worked from a small city lot in Sydney. Great propagation to US during the first VK night. There were many great NA signals on the band - ND7K, W8KA, K2KW, K3ZM, K8LX, K1LT, K3LR, K7NJ, NA7TB, just to mention a few. Working QRP from VK on 160m is not trivial. My only NA QSO was K1LT. The propagation to NA lasted surprisingly long, however not for me as the whole band was completely wiped out by a broadband interference. Having dedicated RX antennas did not help. The first VK morning to EU had a phenomenal propagation that only lasted for some 30 minutes at my QTH. I do not remember hearing such impressive signals on 160m. Ever. Even when working as VK9LL from Lord Howe years ago. Very happy having worked LY4A. Thank you all for making this such a great contest!

SOAPBOX: I saw a spot for KH6AQ and decided to try to work him, despite having a 160m inverted vee antenna has a high SWR and running low power with a tuner. After working him, I decided to work more stations so he would not be a unique. During the QSO with the third station worked in the contest, the tuner in the radio became very upset. So, I shut down for this contest.

SOAPBOX: My time on the air was limited to two hours as family
SOAPBOX: requirements took prioirty.  I planned to operate for about 6
SOAPBOX: hours but upon startup realized I had changed settings within my
SOAPBOX: computer and hadn't document the changes as well as I should
SOAPBOX: have.  As a result I spent most of my time tracking down my setup
SOAPBOX: issues.  Eventually all was working the way it should have been
SOAPBOX: four hours ago.  I almost didn't turn this in due to a very low
SOAPBOX: score however Bill , AE0EE encouraged me to do so.   The contest
SOAPBOX: was fun.  I came very close to snagging several South Pacific

SOAPBOX: I struggled for contacts. My FT-817 set at 5 watts to an outbacker joey vertical
SOAPBOX: on my back patio wasn't very effective. I could hear the big guns, but breaking
SOAPBOX: through for a contact was tough going. I took Sunday morning off to attend the
SOAPBOX: Massillon Amateur Radio Club Hamfest because it just wasn't working for me.
SOAPBOX: Bring back the sumspots so I can make contacts more easily running my QRP
SOAPBOX: station. Ny score reflects my frustrations.

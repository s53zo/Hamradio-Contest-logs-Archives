SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I had used this KH6 station remotely for JARTS RTTY, so I thought I'd
SOAPBOX: try it during CQ WW SSB too.  I noticed in the CQ WW Records for
SOAPBOX: Oceania  there was no entry in SO QRP (A) 20m or 40m. I only planned
SOAPBOX: to operate a few hours the first day, so 20m would work better for me
SOAPBOX: than 40m. I setup the remote equipment early Friday and tested it
SOAPBOX: on the target site and another site.  All seemed well.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: At the opening bell, 20m wasn't really open from KH6 to anywhere. The
SOAPBOX: few USA and Caribbean I could hear were weak and running stations
SOAPBOX: louder than me, so at QRP I couldn't get noticed. So, time for a break...
SOAPBOX: I checked the propagation maps and with SFI 218, the MUF around
SOAPBOX: Hawaii was over 40 MHz - not good for 20m band :) The X Class Flare
SOAPBOX: just 2 hours earlier wasn't helping either.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: An hour later conditions were much better and I worked zones 3, 4,
SOAPBOX: 5 and 31. No luck getting through the early pileups to the Caribbean
SOAPBOX: or South America DX. I guess being QRP and 2,000 miles from
SOAPBOX: anybody makes pileup busting difficult.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: At 03Z conditions were fairly normal, and I put 12 more countries in the
SOAPBOX: log. Then I shutdown so my wife could get some sleep without me
SOAPBOX: "yelling" into the radio...
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I checked at 13Z still night in Hawaii) and heard only weak South
SOAPBOX: Americans, two middling VK's, and extremely weak Europeans.
SOAPBOX: Oops, there had been another X Class Flare at 17Z.   At 18Z only a
SOAPBOX: few weak stations.  Still no loud, new stations at 22Z.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: Better signals at 02z like the FR/DJ7RJ station, but I couldn't break
SOAPBOX: the pileup QRP.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: My operator time ran out.  I had worked my 14 Countries, 8 Zones for
SOAPBOX: the possible first entry and record for Oceania, SO QRP (A) 20m.
SOAPBOX: Clearly, the high solar flux conditions favored 10m (or higher) for
SOAPBOX: activity, but at least I filled in the entry book.

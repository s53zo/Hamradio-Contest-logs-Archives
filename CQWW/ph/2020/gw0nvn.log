SOAPBOX: Unfortunately I was unable to prepare in advance for CQWW SSB and
SOAPBOX: thought I would miss it.  I had no working antenna system or radio
SOAPBOX: shack.  However late on Sunday after clearing 10m of Clymatis Montana
SOAPBOX: ( great for hiding masts ), I discovered that my 160m Inverted ‘U’
SOAPBOX: was still there.  But no coax feeder.  So I untangled it and set up
SOAPBOX: the feed point so I could measure it at a later date.
SOAPBOX: Listening on the Derby Topband Online SDR  ( www.1942KHZ.net ) showed
SOAPBOX: plenty of stations on.  So I measured the resonance of the antenna.
SOAPBOX: Finding it very close to the bottom of 160m.  A re-adjustment of the
SOAPBOX: wire, an extra earth spike and some short leads to the old earth mat
SOAPBOX: brought the antenna into resonance and a low vswr on Topband.  A fresh
SOAPBOX: run of coax and a rig set up on the kitchen work top.  With two hours
SOAPBOX: before the end of the contest I was on the air.
SOAPBOX: Plenty of strong stations, but no replies.  DF0HQ gave me a QRZ but no
SOAPBOX: more.  Was the antenna radiating?  Even a Dummy Load shows a low vswr.
SOAPBOX: I quickly grabbed a roll of cable and clipped one end to the earth
SOAPBOX: spike and rolled it out as a radial.  Instant success, DF0HQ first
SOAPBOX: call.  I then added another short radial and started to work the
SOAPBOX: stations.
SOAPBOX: I am pleased with the stations worked in the short time I was on air.
SOAPBOX: I was really pleased to hear VY2ZM at the usual time of 2330 onwards.
SOAPBOX: Hope everyone has a good year, stay safe, 73’s   GW0NVN

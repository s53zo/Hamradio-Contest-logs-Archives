SOAPBOX: The call sign VE9UNB is held by Richard Tervo, VE1BMR, who did
SOAPBOX: not participate as an operator in this contest.  The licensed
SOAPBOX: participants in this contest were Gleb Egorov, VE9EG, and
SOAPBOX: myself, Brent Petersen, VE9EX.  Under my direct supervision,
SOAPBOX: the unlicensed participants in this contest were Sameh Elnaggar,
SOAPBOX: Fred Goora and Tristan Losier, who recently passed, with HF
SOAPBOX: privileges, their amateur radio examinations.  Friday evening,
SOAPBOX: Fred and I made a few QSOs.  After failing to contact a rare
SOAPBOX: DX station, for about ten minutes, we heard Rick, VE9HF, just
SOAPBOX: across the Saint John River from VE9UNB, get through.  I figured
SOAPBOX: the rare DX wouldn't be able to hear me and I made the error
SOAPBOX: of trying to get a contact with Rick, on the DX's frequency.
SOAPBOX: Rick knew the DX would hear him; he politely followed the DX Code
SOAPBOX: of Conduct and ignored me.  Saturday morning, all five of us
SOAPBOX: were present.  One of the participants made a trivial operator
SOAPBOX: error.  I mentioned that was nothing compared to the error that
SOAPBOX: I made on Friday evening while I was suppose to be demonstrating
SOAPBOX: good operating procedures.  A short while later we heard Rick
SOAPBOX: calling CQ.  I said that was the same guy from Friday evening.
SOAPBOX: I went for the microphone and answered his CQ.  He said: "Hi."
SOAPBOX: I said: "Thanks."  We logged the QSO and the five of us burst
SOAPBOX: into laughter.

NAME: SAKAAKI ASHIKAWA
CREATED-BY:
SOAPBOX: I paticipate in 160m low power.
SOAPBOX: This was the 4th SSB contest since the 160m SSB
SOAPBOX: was lifted in Japan.
SOAPBOX: Japan's 160m SSB band has only 30KHz witdh, from
SOAPBOX: 1845 to 1875KHz(LSB lower limit is 1848KHz).
SOAPBOX: On the other hand, domestic local rag chews
SOAPBOX: are always held during the contest. Local lag chews
SOAPBOX: in Europe and the United States are performed at
SOAPBOX: frequencies of 1880 KHz or higher, but in Japan,
SOAPBOX: SSB DX WINDOW and domestic lag chews are mixed.
SOAPBOX: Furthermore, DX SSB stations cannot be called
SOAPBOX: because SSB is prohibited below 1845 KHz.
SOAPBOX: Western stations will surely earn points if they
SOAPBOX: use the Internet etc. to find frequencies that are
SOAPBOX: not lag chewed in Japan and have them run CQ!
SOAPBOX: My score was 154 in 2020, 171 in 2021,209 in 2022.
SOAPBOX: Only 30 in 2023.

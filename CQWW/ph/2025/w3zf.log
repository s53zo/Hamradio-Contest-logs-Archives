SOAPBOX: Dusted off my Drake T-4B twins and was just happy to get them up and running and make a few QSOs I made a whole 6 contacts in total. Imagine my disappointment when I contacted NN6DX (a contest station) and was asked if I really needed this QSO as it would not benefit my score. I told him I wasn't competitive (as I was just savoring my tube rigs for the 1st time this year!) WHAT KIND OF AMATEUR BEHAVES LIKE THAT! JUST GIVE ME A REPORT AND GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS!

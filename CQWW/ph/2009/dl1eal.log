NAME: Roland Lehmann
SOAPBOX: Many stations ignored the IARU Band Plans, especially in the 40m band.
SOAPBOX: Some were running well below the phone segment, in some cases as low
SOAPBOX: as 7,020 kHz, which is reserved area for CW DX window in Region 2.
SOAPBOX: In this way they have gained an unacceptable advantage over those who
SOAPBOX: complied to the band plan and had to endure the usual QRM on the band.
SOAPBOX: I will not mention any specific callsign; you may want to check out
SOAPBOX: the respective DX cluster records, if you like, and take appropriate
SOAPBOX: disciplinary actions. This behavior not only violates contest rules
SOAPBOX: (and Ham Spirit), but also ruins a large segment of the band for
SOAPBOX: those who are not taking part in the contest, trying to run QSOs in
SOAPBOX: CW or digital modes.
SOAPBOX: For protest I only submit one QSO in my contest log.

SOAPBOX: For clarification:
SOAPBOX: 1) general: I participated from Elba Island, Italy. Since I hold a
SOAPBOX: belgian callsign ON2PAM, I needed to use the prefix IA5 for Isola d'Elba
SOAPBOX: according CEPT regulations. Therefor, I participated as IA5/ON2PAM. I added
SOAPBOX: the grid locator for the location I operated from in the file. The operating address was
SOAPBOX: Via del Moletto, 125, 57031 Lacona LI, Italy. This is not the postal address
SOAPBOX: that I use, as I was here only for a short time, during the CQWW. I noted my
SOAPBOX: registered postal address in the file.

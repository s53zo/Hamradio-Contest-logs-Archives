SOAPBOX: Shameless "Updated CQ Contest Policy Relating to Russia's Invasion of
SOAPBOX: Ukraine" ruined my plans to take part in my 49th CQ WW DX SSB Contest.
SOAPBOX: I consider this move as a political CQ staff's decision which probably
SOAPBOX: saves little amount of magazine subscribers, but prevents participants
SOAPBOX: that follow moral principles of most sports activities - to not have any
SOAPBOX: connections with aggressor countries - from serious competition in the
SOAPBOX: event. I consider this CQ move as filling up the fuel tank for Putin's
SOAPBOX: war machine... Therefore only two symbolic QSO's with ES9UKR station
SOAPBOX: were made. I hope CQ will reconsider its amoral decision and will go
SOAPBOX: back to the situation We had before August 31 st.

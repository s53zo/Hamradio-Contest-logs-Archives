SOAPBOX: First contest worked from my new QTH in Old Lyme, CT. This QTH is quiet so I could hear NA, SA, EU, and AF but, transmitting only 100 W in SSB, I could not be heard more than about 400 km away. I hope to have an amp and perhaps a tuner connected for the CW contest in November.
SOAPBOX: So far my only antenna is a Lazy-H (end-loaded vertical dipole) resonant at 1.8 MHz.

SOAPBOX: I entered the CQ WW CW 2019 as a CW QRP Op with just 5W and a 5/8th
SOAPBOX: Vertical for 20m. My Key of operation was a German WW2 Junkers
SOAPBOX: Kreigsmarine Key of the most beautiful movement. When the Contest
SOAPBOX: started I let the rat race go for it for about an hour, and then
SOAPBOX: decided to see what bands were open. To my surprise 15m was full
SOAPBOX: steam ahead, so away I went. I sent for 26 minutes before my first contact
SOAPBOX: came with JL3RNZ. I next decided to search and contact as the band
SOAPBOX: was full of good signals into Queensland. Oceania was the order of the
SOAPBOX: day, and I scored QRP contacts into JA interspered with V63, 5W1, BD7,
SOAPBOX: XV9, HS0, VR2. The icing on the cake were the following Russians, RA0,
SOAPBOX: RU0, RW0, and my good mate Mickhail RT0C. It almost takes your breath
SOAPBOX: away to sit back with a Vertical and work the world with just 5W.
SOAPBOX: Even the maths say that from 100W to 5W is just 2 S Points.
SOAPBOX: I gave it away at 04:30 UTC for lunch and a break. My next contact
SOAPBOX: was at 07:25 with JA2XYO on 20m. A spell on 40m from 09:35 yeilded a few
SOAPBOX: nice contacts into the USA with N9RV, W7WA, K2PO. Then out of the
SOAPBOX: woodwork came OL3Z at 10:30 UTC for a QRP contact into the Czec
SOAPBOX: Replublic for a distance of 15,676 kilometres. This was probabaly the
SOAPBOX: highlight of the weekend to work Central Europe QRP in the Contest. I
SOAPBOX: gave it away for the evening and kicked off next morning with 15m
SOAPBOX: leading the way once again. A contact straight up into California
SOAPBOX: with N6RO kicked the day off in good form. A few ZL's filled the next hour
SOAPBOX: before working JT5DX up in Mongolia, and KH6LC in Hawaii. Next was
SOAPBOX: off to work for Sunday Night. The following morning I managed to work a
SOAPBOX: few contacts into the USA, with the highlight being KL7RA up in
SOAPBOX: Alaska. And that was it 23:59 and it was all over for another Year. I
SOAPBOX: felt that despite the fact we are at the bottom of the cycle with a
SOAPBOX: few reverse polarity sunspots, that the bands were in pretty good
SOAPBOX: form. I enjoyed the contest and wish to thank all those who were
SOAPBOX: patient enough to work me as a QRP station. Many thanks also to the
SOAPBOX: organizers and assistants that make this competition possible each
SOAPBOX: year through their hard work and voluteering of time. Cheers 73 Mike VK4QS

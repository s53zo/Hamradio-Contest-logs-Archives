SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: So, this were to be my major contest this year. Having a job, a YL and a house
SOAPBOX: really do take to much time from the main thing - contesting.
SOAPBOX: Anyway me and YL had made a deal to go to our cabin for this entire weekend,
SOAPBOX: just for me contesting.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: Planning:
SOAPBOX: Having a city lot where the sides of the yard is 15+20+15+20 and on that
SOAPBOX: property having a house of 170m², a garage and 2 parking lots really does not
SOAPBOX: make it easy for any antennas, especially not for the lower bands.
SOAPBOX: BUT, we have a small cabin about 30Km away with a lake bordering the lot giving
SOAPBOX: free take-off from SW to NW.
SOAPBOX: The place also got a bunch of tall pine trees which I have putten up ropes in
SOAPBOX: the top of. I went down to the cabin the weekend before the contest and put up a
SOAPBOX: fullsize ¼-wave vertical in wire-format. Well, I put 4 elevated radials up at a
SOAPBOX: feedpoint of approx 14m and the radiator was another wire of 20m which I was to
SOAPBOX: send up with a helium baloon having read G4VGOs site http://www.qsl.net/g4vgo/
SOAPBOX: just about too many times.
SOAPBOX: So, I was aiming to get countries on 80m using a quarterwave with a feedpoint up
SOAPBOX: at 14m. What did I need, balloons ofcource and I rented a tube of Helium (Tubes
SOAPBOX: cannot be bought in Sweden) over the weekend for 370 SEK (approx US$50).
SOAPBOX: The downside of the QTH I figured was the antenna for the other bands, what if I
SOAPBOX: got bored with 80m or if worse, something failed? The other antenna was just a
SOAPBOX: 7m high 7 band multiband vertical from ECO. I had worked some DX on it earlier
SOAPBOX: but not much and making it over the pond was alwasy a obstacle.
SOAPBOX: I figured I would have to go for high-power this time wanting to put a effort
SOAPBOX: into the lower bands.
SOAPBOX: Some other planning was needed to be made.
SOAPBOX: First of all I do know myself and I always forget something when going away, my
SOAPBOX: fellows in SK6HD have experianced this many times during our get-togethers in
SOAPBOX: the NAC-50MHz contests, I think I have forgotten the PSU 2 times now, the
SOAPBOX: hot-dogs, the coax etc etc.
SOAPBOX: I made a complete list of everything to bring, from torch, to wood for the
SOAPBOX: fireplace, radio, bla bla bla and I checked them of when packing thursday
SOAPBOX: evening. We had also started allready this fall cutting up alot of wood. The
SOAPBOX: cabin is not insulated and late November in Sweden 250mASL can get quite cold.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: We arrived the contest QTH in late Friday afternoon. The temperature was outside
SOAPBOX: +1°C and believe it or not, the inside temperature of the cabin was -1°C
SOAPBOX: (30°F).
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: First thing before even unpacking the vehicle was to start the fireplace.
SOAPBOX: Unload the car, eat and build up expectations of the vertical for 80m. Could you
SOAPBOX: imagine, I had been waiting for this moment since August. The wind was still, I
SOAPBOX: would not get a leaning antenna, it was all to perfect.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: I went to bed for 3 hours before the contest so that I could sit up all night
SOAPBOX: enjoying DX contacts on 80. My YL woke me up around midnight and we went out to
SOAPBOX: load the helium into the ballons and ship the antenna skywards. It was now
SOAPBOX: around 0°C and wet chrystals were raining. Not snow, not rain, just the air full
SOAPBOX: of chrystals. I connected the ballons to the line and let go, they went up fast
SOAPBOX: and everything looked just perfect for a few seconds.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: Disappointment:
SOAPBOX: The ballons made it even hight with the tops of the pine-trees, then they would
SOAPBOX: make it no further. I do not know how much I tried to add on more ballons, cut
SOAPBOX: the control line, use less fasteners for the balons. It just would not work.
SOAPBOX: I am not sure what exactly was wrong.
SOAPBOX: Was my ½mm³ to heavy?
SOAPBOX: Was there not enough wind to lift?
SOAPBOX: Was there turbulence around the treetops?
SOAPBOX: Was the cold weather or the chrystals making the trouble?
SOAPBOX: I have no idea except that I lost almost the first hour of the contest.
SOAPBOX: I was just to stubborn and things did not go my way, but, I would a least give
SOAPBOX: 40m a chance.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: Regaining happiness:
SOAPBOX: 40m is a great DX band, the only problem is getting a free space in between to
SOAPBOX: call CQ. I did not succeed and I am to much of a gentlement to squeze myslef in
SOAPBOX: by force so it was search and pounce which was the deal.
SOAPBOX: The antenna, as told before, could have been better and the thought hit me
SOAPBOX: several times during the night to make a wire vertical for 40m instead but the
SOAPBOX: ECO vertical was playing quite nicely this evening and I did get a few new ones
SOAPBOX: in the log.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: Next day I did rebuild the antenna for 80m just so that I could get some QSOs
SOAPBOX: and perhaps a few new ones on 80. That was a good decision.
SOAPBOX: I did get quite some new ones on 80m, before the contest I had only worked 47
SOAPBOX: countries on 80m, during the contest I worked 57 coutries landing on 66 instead
SOAPBOX: of 47. 40m made me go from 95 to 102 so that was equally good. 20 gave me 4 new
SOAPBOX: countries and 160m 1 new band country allthough I did not have a antenna for
SOAPBOX: 160m. 
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: The contest also gave me my 203rd country!
SOAPBOX: HP1/OA4WW - Thanx for a new country
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: Now, it is time for QSLing.
SOAPBOX: 
SOAPBOX: I hope to have you all in the log next time and god knows what stupid ideas I
SOAPBOX: will come up with before then. I allready started thinking about a 2el
SOAPBOX: halfsquare for 80m. Only thing is, I do not know what Pine trees would support
SOAPBOX: it yet.

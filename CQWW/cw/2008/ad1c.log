SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: This contest was either a labor of love, or stupidity, or both.  An average of
SOAPBOX: 15 QSOs/hour for 24 hours?  Surely there's a better way to spend one's time!
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I spent the 1.5 weeks before the contest checking out 20 meters before I went
SOAPBOX: to work, trying to determine when European signals peaked.  I was hoping to
SOAPBOX: work a bunch in the contest.  Having a K index of 0 didn't hurt.  Friday
SOAPBOX: morning I worked LZ, HA, PA, YU and HB0 between 1530-1630z, so was feeling
SOAPBOX: good.  Right before the contest started, I worked DJ, 9A and OM on 40, so was
SOAPBOX: feeling even better that I would put lots of Europe into my log.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I started the contest on 20, figuring 40 would be bedlam.  I was rewarded by
SOAPBOX: working RW0CWA and DU3NXE as my first two QSOs.  I had never worked a Zone 27
SOAPBOX: before from this QTH!  I worked a few JAs and a KH6, and headed to 40, but I
SOAPBOX: was unable to work any Europe.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I set the alarm to wake up at 1030z (3:30 a.m. local time), hoping to catch
SOAPBOX: some of the Caribbean on 40 before the sun rose there and they left to go work
SOAPBOX: Europe on 20.  Though I worked some, I don't think the mission was that
SOAPBOX: successful.  However, I did pick up VK6LW at 1046z, my first Zone 29 from this
SOAPBOX: QTH, followed by ZM1A at 1049z, my first ZL.  After working three VEs, and
SOAPBOX: taking a break to work T31DX on 40SSB, I took an hour off and came back at
SOAPBOX: 1343z. This time, I worked a few more JAs, then B5A at 1349z for my first China
SOAPBOX: and Zone 24!  After a few more JAs and VEs, I pulled the plug on 40 and finally
SOAPBOX: went up to 20 (I had been checking 20 earlier, but hadn't heard any Europe).
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: OM7M was my first Europe of the contest at 1430z.  At 1551z, I worked 9A5P, who
SOAPBOX: was essentially the last Europe I'd work Saturday, though I did work CT1JLZ
SOAPBOX: about 20 minutes later.  I made my first two QSOs on 15 at 1621z (PZ5TT and an
SOAPBOX: always loud CU2X - that would be the ONLY Europe I work on 15 during the entire
SOAPBOX: contest). Back to 20, worked EE5W at 1704z, and was fortunate to get through to
SOAPBOX: OX5WW at 1711z for the double mult.  Another trip to 15 to work P40W and 6Y1V,
SOAPBOX: who was one of the loudest, most consistent stations on 15 during the contest.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: At 1640z, I tuned to 10 meters, heard KO7X and had a partial QSO, which I
SOAPBOX: didn't log. Sorry, Alan.  I didn't hear anyone else on 10 the entire weekend.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: At 2045 I broke through the 3X5A pileup on 20.  Though I heard them on both 15
SOAPBOX: and 40 later, this was my only QSO with the VooDudes.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: The rest of the day, I basically bounced between 20 and 15 trying to work
SOAPBOX: anything new I heard.  I checked 40 at 2025z, worked VY2TT but didn't hear any
SOAPBOX: Europe. At 2239z, I finally worked TM2S on 40, followed by CU2X and EF8M, but
SOAPBOX: that was it.  Back on 20, I worked RW0LT at 2350z, followed by KG6DX (on the
SOAPBOX: first call) a few minutes later.  I worked 6 more Europeans on 40 between 0001
SOAPBOX: and 0023z, but then had to QRT to go to a birthday party.  I was not thrilled
SOAPBOX: with how few Europeans I had worked on 40, though I knew it was going to be
SOAPBOX: tough.  Some were loud and CQ'd in my face, some were not that loud but came
SOAPBOX: back on the first call.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: At the half-way point, I had just over 200 QSOs and had already worked 10 new
SOAPBOX: ones for my Colorado restart DXCC.  I made a list of "easy" mults I had worked
SOAPBOX: on other bands but missed on 20 (6Y, 8P, V4, V2, HI, FJ, VP5, YS, CO, KP4 and
SOAPBOX: HK).  Before the contest ended, I had worked them all except for CO.  There
SOAPBOX: were lots of Cubans on 40, but few on 20.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I returned from the party and got back on the air at 0630z.  Picked up some
SOAPBOX: good double mults like PR1T and D4C.  My antenna doesn't really work on 80, but
SOAPBOX: I made a decision to go there just before going to sleep, to pick up the easy K,
SOAPBOX: VE, Zone 3 and 4 multipliers.  Thanks to the VE7SV op on 40 who told me where to
SOAPBOX: find them on 80.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I abandoned the 10z wakeup Sunday morning and didn't get back on the air until
SOAPBOX: 1330z.  More JAs and VEs on 40, found VE2XAA/2 for the Zone 2 mult.  I had
SOAPBOX: written myself a note about the total lack of Scandinavia (LA/OH/SM) and Zone
SOAPBOX: 16 in the contest, then just after that, I worked OH6M at 1402z and 5 minutes
SOAPBOX: later SK3W for two new mults on 40.  I heard a couple of Russians, but not
SOAPBOX: strong enough to get their attention.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I got started again on 20 at 1421z, and worked more Europe until 1635z.  Once
SOAPBOX: 20 dies to Europe, it's really dead, at least at my QTH.  So I went to 15,
SOAPBOX: worked VE2XAA/2 for a rare double-mult.  15 was very spotty.  Signals came up
SOAPBOX: out of the noise for a little bit, then disappeared.  So I just sat on the loud
SOAPBOX: stations and called until I worked them or gave up.  I repeated this a couple of
SOAPBOX: times, and added a few new mults each time.  I couldn't get through to KP2M for
SOAPBOX: some reason, even though they had a decent signal on 15.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I checked 40 again at 2114z, worked VA3NR but still no Europe.  So it was back
SOAPBOX: to 20 for all but the last 15 minutes of the contest, except for working 8P5A
SOAPBOX: at 2307z on 40 (I kept checking 40, but no action).  I called CQ once the
SOAPBOX: entire weekend (14088.77, a good frequency :-), hoping to have a few JAs call
SOAPBOX: in, and a zero-pointer came back at 2212z.  That was it!  I worked every JA I
SOAPBOX: could find, including beating K1TTT to JS6RGY at 2335z (take that, Dave :-) but
SOAPBOX: also got very lucky and worked AH0BT at 2248z, and YE1ZAT at 2312z.  I probably
SOAPBOX: spent too much time calling the YE1, and should have been trying to work stuff
SOAPBOX: on 40, but I couldn't help myself.  The same thing happened with the two OA4s
SOAPBOX: on 20.  I called OA4SS for a long time as I could hear the pileup dwindling.
SOAPBOX: Then someone spotted it and the pileup grew again.  Argh!  Same thing with
SOAPBOX: VP2MDG.  I called OA4WW on-and-off a few times, and finally got through, but it
SOAPBOX: took a long time.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: In the last 10 minutes, I worked M6T, OK5W and OM7M on 40 for two new mults.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: I was disappointed to not work KL7 on 40, which would have been my last state
SOAPBOX: on that band. I was also looking for FJ/WJ2O on 15 for an all-time new band
SOAPBOX: country, but didn't get that one either.
SOAPBOX:
SOAPBOX: Overall, I added 20 new countries to my DXCC total, now at 118 worked.  I added
SOAPBOX: 4 new zones (24, 27, 28 and 29).  I worked 83 different entities in the contest.
SOAPBOX:  I gained a little more confidence with the station capabilities.  And I had
SOAPBOX: fun, which is the most important part!

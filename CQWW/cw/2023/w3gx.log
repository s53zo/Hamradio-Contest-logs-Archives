SOAPBOX: First--and last--real shot at the CQ WW CW. After serious work toward code mastery, averaged 15 minutes to get a QSO in the log. Not efficient, not the least bit competitive. There's already a laundry list of CQ WW overlay categories. How about divisions based on maximum Code speed? In boxing a heavyweight could cream a featherweight. Likewise, at 35 wpm, there's no discernable difference between the letters "S," and "H," and the numbers "4," and "5." Yet I have to admire all the systems engineering in the PC- and memory-driven auto-keyers I heard.

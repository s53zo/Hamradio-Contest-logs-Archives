SOAPBOX: Busy weekend as we kicked off the holiday season with friends and family. Had
SOAPBOX: two hours to slip away and figured I would try to have some fun on 10. While
SOAPBOX: the window I had was probably not the best for 10, I enjoyed each and every
SOAPBOX: contact. For me QRP is fun when I log a station down the street so logging a
SOAPBOX: station thousands of miles away is a blast.
SOAPBOX: This first time using the MDR7506 Headphones, I had been eying them for awhile
SOAPBOX: and wanted to try them. I need to do some more comparisons with these versus my
SOAPBOX: noise cancelling Sony headphones to determine what was better but in general I
SOAPBOX: think the MDR7506 were easy on the ears and the range made picking up the code
SOAPBOX: relaxing.
SOAPBOX: This was also my first entry into the CQWW CW contest. Certainly not a winning
SOAPBOX: entry but a couple of points for the club aggregate score and happy I got on.
SOAPBOX: Thanks for the Q's!

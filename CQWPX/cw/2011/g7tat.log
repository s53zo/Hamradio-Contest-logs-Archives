SOAPBOX:                1st timer. This was my first CW contest and also my
SOAPBOX:                first on-air CW contacts. There is no way I can
SOAPBOX:                read CW at that speed, so I used DM780 (part of the
SOAPBOX:                HRD package) on RX ONLY. My TX was sent by hand
SOAPBOX:                with a straight morse key, very slowly (probably
SOAPBOX:                about 10wpm). I'm greatful to the ops that took the
SOAPBOX:                time to persevere with me.
SOAPBOX:                Great fun, but I must improve my morse speed for
SOAPBOX:                next year.

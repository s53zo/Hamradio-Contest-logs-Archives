SOAPBOX: I am a new YL CW operator with only 10 months of learning code. I have never participated in WPX contest. It is still too fast for my copying skills. I do not use a decoder. Even though I only got 7 contacts it was fun to have a bit of a taste of this contest. Kudos to those who made thousands of QSO. Thanks to those who were part of those 7 contacts. I was asked for the NR? again. I am sure it was because I was giving them such low numbers they needed to confirm what they really heard was true especially during the second day. I just participated for not more than one hour all together with a lot of interruptions from my 6 years old daughter. 73 de KQ3Q

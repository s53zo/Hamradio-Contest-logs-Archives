SOAPBOX: Nah... Still too fast. To do this contest you need a CW decoder
SOAPBOX: and pre-recorded messages. When in CW contests I forget trying
SOAPBOX: to copy far end exchange info. I'm great if I get his or her
SOAPBOX: call sign right. (That at least constitues a "QSO," folks!). But after
SOAPBOX: 1-1/2 hours--and just one, three-character call sign in the
SOAPBOX: log--that's it... Gonna stick with 'till I copy "real" 20 wpm. But with
SOAPBOX: 76 years, and prostate cancer, it"ll be close. 73 'till next
SOAPBOX: time.

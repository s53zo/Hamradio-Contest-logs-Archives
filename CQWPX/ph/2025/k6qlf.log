NAME: Ron Fitch
OPERATORS: WQ6X
CLUB: AMATEUR RADIO CLUB OF ALAMEDA
CREATED-BY: N1MM Logger+ 1.0.8930.0
SOAPBOX: After an ad-HOC WPX Ssb demonstration for the Amateur Radio Club of Alameda
SOAPBOX: (ARCA) at the Oakland Yacht Club (in Alameda), the club president (WQ6X)
SOAPBOX: configured a new N1MM+ log for WPX running the ARCA Club callsign K6QLF.
SOAPBOX: The main impetus was to give hearable operators a 2nd call to work
SOAPBOX: (besides WA6OYC). Because 10-meters seemed to be "least affected"
SOAPBOX: by sailboat RFI, the decision was made to run 10-meters only.
SOAPBOX: I ran the ICOM 7300 running off of a marine battery into a horizontal
SOAPBOX: J-Pole antenna atop the Yacht Club's 3-Story high building.
SOAPBOX: Calling CQ only elicited 1-QSO, but several commented on the
SOAPBOX: "coolness" of the K6QLF callsign.
SOAPBOX: Bottomline, the group got an exposure to Radiosport Pandemonium (WPX-Style)
SOAPBOX: and the onsite J-Pole was given a thorough 10-meter performance test.
SOAPBOX: Look for a write-up on this at: http://WQ6X.Blogspot.com

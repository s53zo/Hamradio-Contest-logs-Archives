SOAPBOX: In the Japanese band plan, SSB is only 30KHz wide from 1845 to 1875KHz.
SOAPBOX: Moreover, since it is LSB, 1848KHz is the limit on the lower side, so
SOAPBOX: you cannot call a DX station that runs at 1845KHz. (Because the lower
SOAPBOX: wave band 3KHz of LSB enters the digital band) Since the Japanese band
SOAPBOX: plan is treated the same as the Radio Law provisions, there are penal
SOAPBOX: provisions for administrative sanctions,so amateur radio operators are
SOAPBOX: free to do so at the time of the contest.
SOAPBOX: It cannot be changed. Therefore, DX stations should fully understand
SOAPBOX: that only 1848 to 1875KHz can communicate with Japanese stations via
SOAPBOX: SSB.

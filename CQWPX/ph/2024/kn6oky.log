SOAPBOX: 2021-04-13 Initial License grant date. (Last time I can enter as a rookie category). Overall, this was fun despite bad weather and just a couple hours to work it. I took a portable set with me to operate QRP and a vertical antenna. The park site was good and easy to get to. However, I was not well equipped for the weather and several rain showers hampered operations, till the last one came down pretty hard which I had to cease operations and pack up. I would do this again next year. 73 to all that did a QSO with me.

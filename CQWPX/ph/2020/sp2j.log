SOAPBOX: Licensed as SP1MM my oldest license this is my base station in Warsaw. Due to the coronavirus, we went to the forest, where I have another station licensed as SP2J (in PL it is more of a locator based)
SOAPBOX: Indicating ROOKIE I used my latest license - SP1MM from 29 May 2017
SOAPBOX: It has only one QSO, due to the problems with my external ATU I'm afraid I might have damaged internal SWR meter in my brand new ic7300
SOAPBOX: I made one QSO with CT1EGF after I kind of sorted myself out (this log is more of a courtesy for him). But following that QSO my carbon-fiber pole snapped taking my random wire vertical down.
SOAPBOX: What an evening it was! If You have a certificate for the ABSOLUTE LAST STATION, please send me a paper one

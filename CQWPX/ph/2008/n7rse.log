SOAPBOX: This is my first contest.  I thought some of the rules for scoring
SOAPBOX: were not very clear.  Rule (b) and (c) seem to contradict each other
SOAPBOX: for stations in North America.  The rules should be unambiguous for
SOAPBOX: first time contesters.  I guess I'll understand better after my
SOAPBOX: results are officially scored.  I also think the definition of a
SOAPBOX:
CATEGORY-OPERATOR: SINGLE-OP
CATEGORY-TRANSMITTER: ONE
CATEGORY-ASSISTED: NON-ASSISTED
CATEGORY-BAND: ALL
CATEGORY-POWER: LOW
CATEGORY-STATION: FIXED
